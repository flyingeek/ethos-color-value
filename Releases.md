If you prefer the manual method, unzip, open and drag the folder named exactly _color-value_ in your radio's script folder.

After installation two new widgets are available: _Color Value_ and _Color Telemetry_, both share the same code but _Color Telemetry_ restrict the Source of the value to be a telemetry sensor.
